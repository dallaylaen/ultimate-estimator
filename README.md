# The Ultimate Task Estimator

Actually a very simple single-page app that helps breaking down a big task
into smaller ones.

No backend is present, the logic is in the page, plus there are
download/upload links that allow to save current state of the estimator
as JSON.

Written using an ugly homegrown 
["framework"](https://github.com/dallaylaen/sandbox-jRna)
and probably needs to be re-done using a real one.

# Content of this package

`docs/index.html` - the application itself.

`docs/js` - the "framework" and a jquery standalone version.

# TODO

* Normal CSS wanted;

* Save current state via page storage, no need to save/load too often;

* Add complexity multiplier and weekly amount of productive time;

* Better help.
